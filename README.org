* Emacs Runtime Passwords

Instead of hard-coding passwords into your =.emacs= use this library
to pull them out of an external resource, like a file.  This makes
sharing your configuration files easier.

If you put passwords into a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values][tab-separated file]] =~/.passwords=

: # ~/.passwords
: irc	Ohf5Eiwa
: gmail	1aeghieD7

and set

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq runtime-passwords-file "~/.passwords")
#+END_SRC

Then you can ask for a password by its key with

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(runtime-password-get "gmail")
#+END_SRC

You can use this form inside your =.emacs= to separate your Emacs
configuration from credentials you need during that configuration.
